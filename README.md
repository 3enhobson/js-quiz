# js-quiz

## Description

This challenge really pushed me to my limit. I spent hours on the javascript catching bugs and making sure everything worked the way I had envisioned it to. At first it seemed like an impossible task and now Im able to look at it and confidently say that Im proud of what I've learned in just a few weeks of this bootcamp. I had fun messing around with the CSS to give it a look that I wasnt bored with after going through the quiz as many times as I did, and Im happy with the result. I learned some new ways to style a page, I learned how to link multiple pages together. and most importantly I feel a little more comfortable using Javascript. 

## Usage
